## Liver Disease Prediction

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

Perfoming ML algorithm to predict the person is having liver disease or not.After performing various classification techniques and taking into account their accuracies, we can conclude all the models had an accuracy ranging from 71% to 85%. Out of which XGBoost Algorithm gave a slightly better accuracy of 84.61%.
