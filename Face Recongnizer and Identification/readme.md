# Face Recognizer and Identification

This is a simple python code in which we have to identify the face in the live feed capture by our webcam and then identifying the name of the person in the image. This recognizer is trained in small amount of data which is why it is not 100% accurate. This Recognizer can identify Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage and me(Raghav).

For any reference, kindly check the `example.jpg` in which the screenshot of the test is stored.
