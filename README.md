## Liver Disease Prediction

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

Perfoming ML algorithm to predict the person is having liver disease or not.After performing various classification techniques and taking into account their accuracies, we can conclude all the models had an accuracy ranging from 71% to 85%. Out of which XGBoost Algorithm gave a slightly better accuracy of 84.61%.



## Mercari Dataset Price Suggestion and Modelling

Mercari is an online shopping marketplace which is powered by one of the biggest community of Japan where users can sell pretty much anything.The community wants to offer price suggestions to the sellers but is a tough task as the sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercariâ€™s marketplace.

We will build various supervised machine learning regression models and see which succeeds in solving the given mapping between the input variables and the price feature in the best way.


## Face Recognizer and Identification

This is a simple python code in which we have to identify the face in the live feed capture by our webcam and then identifying the name of the person in the image. This recognizer is trained in small amount of data which is why it is not 100% accurate. This Recognizer can identify Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage and me(Raghav).

For any reference, kindly check the `example.jpg` in which the screenshot of the test is stored.
