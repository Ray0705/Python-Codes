# Mercari Dataset Price Suggestion and Modelling
Mercari is an online shopping marketplace which is powered by one of the biggest community of Japan where users can sell pretty much anything.The community wants to offer price suggestions to the sellers but is a tough task as the sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercariâ€™s marketplace.

We will build various supervised machine learning regression models and see which succeeds in solving the given mapping between the input variables and the price feature in the best way.
